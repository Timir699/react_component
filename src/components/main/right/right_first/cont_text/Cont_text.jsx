            <p>I am Rijwan Hossain, a JavaScript 
                complete (MERN) stack developer. 
                I love working in React, NodeJS, 
                ExpressJS. React is a great library. 
                This site is build in React. React is 
                only for front end development.</p>

             <p>For back-end development or bussiness processing layer, 
                 I use NodeJS. It is a run-time or a compiler. This helps 
                 a machine to run JavaScript code and compile it to machine
                 language code. 
                 I use ExpressJS which is a very popular framework of NodeJS.</p>
